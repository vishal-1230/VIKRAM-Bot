        question: "How do I get started with creating my own bot?",
        answer: "You start by registering on the VIKRAM platform and defining the specializations for your bot. After verification, a bot with a unique ID is created for you. You can then use the training tab to define roles, role descriptions, and steps that your bot should follow. After enough interactions and refinements, your bot will be ready to serve others."

        question: "How can I make money with my VIKRAM bot?",
